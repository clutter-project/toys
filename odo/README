This work has been superceded by the MxDeformTexture widget in the Mx
toolkit. Mx is available from git,

git://git.moblin.org/mx

The effects here are all included in Mx, along with tweaks to improve
their function, and the MxDeformTexture widget itself is better structured
to allow for animating properties with clutter_actor_animate ().
