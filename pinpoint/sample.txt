Start by writing down the core concepts of
what you will be talking about sort them and
format them as a pinpoint presentation, if
this was a presentation given as a
demonstration of pinpoint you would now be
be trying to read this slide as well as pay
attention to what is said. Pinpoint reloads
the presentation if you change it on disk, 
this is useful when tuning things, keep both
programs open. And remember Less text in a
slide is almost always better. ;)
