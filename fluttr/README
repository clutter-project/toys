A clutter-based flickr viewer.

Authorising yourself with Flickr
================================

Type this url into your web-browser of choice:

http://www.flickr.com/auth-72157600141007022

You will then be askd to log into flickr (or not if you are already logged in).
The next screen will ask you if you want to let Fluttr access your Flickr
pictures, click "OK, I'll allow it", and Flickr will take you to a page which
has a auth code in the middle like this:

123-456-789

Now, start fluttr with that code:

$ fluttr 123-456-789

Fluttr will then contact Flickr and save its settings. From now on, you can just run fluttr without any options.

NB: You may need to restart fluttr after the initial authorisation.
