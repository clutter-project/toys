A clutter-based flickr viewer.

Authorising yourself with Flickr
================================

Type this url into your web-browser of choice:

http://www.flickr.com/auth-72157600141007022

You will then be asked to log into flickr (or not if you are already logged in).
The next screen will ask you if you want to let Fluttr access your Flickr
pictures, click "OK, I'll allow it", and Flickr will take you to a page which
has a auth code in the middle like this:

123-456-789

Now, start fluttr with that code:

$ fluttr 123-456-789

Fluttr will then contact Flickr and save its settings. From now on, you can 
just run fluttr without any options.

NB: You may need to restart fluttr after the initial authorisation.

Using Fluttr
===========

Fluttr is pretty simple in that it can view sets, view photos within a set, 
and finally view a photo. Certain things, like moving between photos when 
maximised, still need to be added.

The main keys for using Fluttr are the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to navigate, 
and Enter to select. Esc will bring you back to the previous menu. If you are
already at 'root level' ie. you can see all the different photo sets, then 
pressing Esc will quit Fluttr. Pressing q at any time will also cause Fluttr 
to quit.

Options
=======
-c, --columns=3      Number of picture columns in the view
-f, --fullscreen     Launch Fluttr in fullscreen mode
-w, --width=800      Width of the Fluttr window
-h, --height=440     Height of the Fluttr window



Know Issues
===========

On some machines, Fluttr does not quit properly (due to a thread problem in 
either libneon or the nflick code), so you may have to kill it. You will 
know that this has happened because your cpu usage will be raised. I am
trying to find the reason for this, or how to prevent it. If you have any 
ideas, you know what to do :).

from the excellent NFlick Flickr browser for the n800 by MDK
