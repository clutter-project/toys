Notes on building the mozilla version:

The mozilla version of mallums-magic-browser requires mozilla built with the
headless backend and ClutterMozEmbed;

git://git.o-hand.com/mozilla-headless.git
git://git.clutter-project.org/clutter-mozembed.git

It also builds against clutter 0.9 instead of 0.8.

To build, you'll want a line something along the lines of;

gcc -o web-browser-mallum web-browser-mallum.c -Wall -g `pkg-config --cflags --libs cluttermozembed` -DWITH_MOZILLA

Which should then produce a binary 'web-browser-mallum'. Note that the  port
to Clutter 0.9 was mmade in a rush, so some animations may not be correct.
