gcr - gegl clutter recorder
===========================

A setup to use interface Clutter with a worker thread using ffmpeg to
encode a Clutter program to video in realtime using GEGL.

This screen recorder has not been written for casual recordings, it requires
you to modify the source of the program you want to record.

The easiest way to integrate gcr in your project is to add a call to:

gcr_prepare ("/tmp/path_to_output.mpg");  /* to prepare for recording */

gcr_start (); /* to start recording */


gcr_stop ();  /* to stop recording (currently not implemented, just quit your
                 application instead) */

The workflow I've been using is to encode to mpeg with high bitrate (hardcoded
in the .c file), and then afterwards transcode this to Theora or some other
codec suitable for distribution.

The includes test example links with clutter-gegl, and also includes a custom
cursor code.
