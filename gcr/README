gcr - gegl clutter recorder
===========================

A setup to use interface Clutter with a worker thread using ffmpeg to
encode a Clutter program to video in realtime using GEGL.

This screen recorder has not been written for casual recordings, it requires
you to modify the source of the program you want to record.

The easiest way to integrate gcr in your project is to add a call to:

gcr ("/tmp/videofile.mpg"); 

just before clutter_main(), this will install a callback after the stage has
repainted that would push captured frames to the encoder thread. I've been
including gcr.c directly in the file containing main to avoid changing build
systems. Make sure your resulting program links against GEGL as well as
clutter.

The workflow I've been using is to encode to mpeg with high bitrate (hardcoded
in the .c file), and then afterwards transcode this to Theora or some other
codec suitable for distribution.

The code does not record the cursor thus it probably is beneficial to draw
your own cursor using clutter when using this screen recorder.
